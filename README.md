--------------

Visualizing data is a powerful way to discover meaning. Current methods are
lackluster because none allow for both direct manipulation of visuals and dynamic
loading of data. Drawing by hand is direct but means a new drawing for every set
of data. Writing code creates dynamic visuals but requires programming
knowledge and blind manipulation of symbols. 

__existential.io__ allows you to
discover the meaning in your data by giving you a guided canvas to draw it into -
directly, dynamically, simply.
